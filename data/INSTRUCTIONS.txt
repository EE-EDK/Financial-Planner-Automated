ABOUT YOUR EXCEL FILE
======================

Your Excel file should have this structure:

Column A: Date (in MM/DD/YYYY format, like 12/25/2025)
Column B: Description (what the expense was for)

Columns C onward: Your budget categories
  - Monthly Expenses (Auto, Car Ins., Medical, Utilities, etc.)
  - Savings Goals (Moms money, Interest, Mower saving, etc.)
  - Account Tracking (Savings, Deposits, Balance)

Important: Put "Totals" in Column A when you're done with your data.
The program stops reading when it sees "Totals".

======================

Monthly Expenses:
- Auto
- B-Day

Note: Column headers in your Excel file MUST match these category names exactly!


NEED TO CHANGE CATEGORIES?

1. Double-click "budget_editor.html"
2. Add or remove categories in each section
3. Click "Save Config"
