HOW TO ADD YOUR TRANSACTIONS
=============================

Since you track manually in Excel, here are two ways to use this program:

OPTION 1: Keep Using Your Excel File (Simplest)
------------------------------------------------
1. Keep tracking in your Excel file like you always do
2. When you want to see a report, save your Excel file as CSV:
   - In Excel: File → Save As
   - Choose "CSV (Comma delimited)" as the format
   - Save it as "transactions.csv" in this folder
3. Run the finance program
4. View your report!

OPTION 2: Use the CSV Template
-------------------------------
1. Open "transactions_template.csv" in Excel
2. Add your transactions following the example format:
   - Date: YYYY-MM-DD (like 2025-12-01)
   - Description: What you bought
   - Category: Must match your budget categories
   - Amount: The cost (positive numbers for expenses)
3. Save as "transactions.csv"
4. Run the finance program

Your Budget Categories:
- Auto
- B-Day
- Car Ins.
- Clothes
- Cycle Ins.
- Extra TSP
- Furniture
- Home Insurance
- Interest
- Janet $
- Medical
- Mower
- Property Taxes
- Savings
- Utilities
- Vacation
- X-mas
- Xtra Car

Remember: The category names must match exactly!
