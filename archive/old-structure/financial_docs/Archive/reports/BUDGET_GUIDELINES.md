## THE "EVERYTHING ELSE" PROBLEM

### What "Everything Else" Typically Includes:
- Random Amazon purchases
- Impulse buys
- Gifts
- Home improvement
- Miscellaneous shopping
- "Just this once" purchases

### Current Reality:
**You spend $1,300+/month in "Everything Else"**

### Target:
**Reduce to $100-200/month maximum**

### How to Control "Everything Else":

1. **Delete Apps**
   - Delete Amazon app
   - Delete shopping apps (Target, Walmart, etc.)
   - Delete food delivery apps

2. **Remove Saved Payment Info**
   - Remove from browsers
   - Remove from websites
   - Make it harder to impulse buy

3. **30-Day Rule**
   - Want something? Wait 30 days
   - Still want it after 30 days? Then consider
   - Most "wants" disappear in 30 days

4. **Before ANY Purchase**:
   - Is this in my budget?
   - Do I NEED this or WANT this?
   - Can I wait 30 days?
   - Is there a free alternative?
   - What am I trading for this? (debt payoff, emergency fund)

## BUDGET FRAMEWORK COMPARISON

### Standard 50/30/20 Rule:
- 50% Needs
- 30% Wants
- 20% Savings

### Your Current Reality:
- 53.5% Needs ✅
- 35.2% Wants 🔴 (should be 20-25%)
- 12.6% Savings 🔴 (should be 20%)

### Your Target (Adjusted for Growing Family):
- 55% Needs ($8,434)
- 25% Wants ($3,834)
- 20% Savings/Debt ($3,067)

### Your Crisis Budget (Until Debt-Free):
- 59% Needs ($9,007) - includes baby prep
- 3% Wants ($450) - minimal discretionary
- 38% Savings/Debt/Buffer ($5,877) - aggressive debt payoff

**This aggressive allocation pays off credit card before April 2026 deadline**
